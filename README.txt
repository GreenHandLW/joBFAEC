Description
This project presents a statistical model of a jointly optimized beamformer-assisted acoustic echo canceler (AEC). The constrained joint optimization problem can be formulated so that it becomes equivalent to the linearly-constrained minimum variance problem. The new formulation leads to analytical models that can be used to predict the transient performance of adaptive wideband beamformers. A stochastic model is derived for the transient and steady-state behaviors of the residual echo power. The convergence analysis provides a stability bound for the adaptation step-size. Monte Carlo simulations can be performed to illustrate the accuracy of the model, which can then used to provide design guidelines. Application of the new model confirms previous experimental findings that the same cancellation performance of a single-microphone AEC can be achieved with a shorter AEC when the possibility of spatial filtering is available.
